Today the range of fields of study examining the economy revolve around the social science of economics, but may include sociology (economic sociology), history (economic history), anthropology (economic anthropology), and geography (economic geography). Practical fields directly related to the human activities involving production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services as a whole, are engineering, management, business administration, applied science, and finance.

All professions, occupations, economic agents or economic activities, contribute to the economy. Consumption, saving, and investment are variable components in the economy that determine macroeconomic equilibrium. There are three main sectors of economic activity: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Sabine Oâ€™Hara argues that care work is the basis for all economic activity, concluding that "everything needs care," not only people, but animals and things.[6]Promoting a green economy would result in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.

Due to the growing importance of the financial sector in modern times,[8] the term real economy is used by analysts[9][10] as well as politicians[11] to denote the part of the economy that is concerned with actually producing goods and services,[12] as ostensibly contrasted with the paper economy, or the financial side of the economy,[13] which is concerned with buying and selling on the financial markets. Alternate and long-standing terminology distinguishes measures of an economy expressed in real values (adjusted for inflation), such as real GDP, or in nominal values (unadjusted for inflation).[14]

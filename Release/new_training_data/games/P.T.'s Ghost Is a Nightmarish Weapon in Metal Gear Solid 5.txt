P.T.'s Ghost Is a Nightmarish Weapon in Metal Gear Solid 5
Watch Big Boss bring new meaning to the words "The Phantom Pain."

Just how badass is Big Boss in MGS5? Well, it turns out he can use the bloodcurdling ghost of P.T. as a weapon in the game, which categorically makes him a monster of imponderable badassness.
The ghost known as Lisa made her distressing debut in the recently released PS4 demo P.T., which is a playable teaser for the upcoming Kojima Productions game Silent Hills.
That studio's creative director, Hideo Kojima, has a history of placing cameos from other games in various Metal Gear titles, but the use of Lisa could quite possibly be the most fiendish.
As showcased in the video above, a blow-up Lisa can be activated as a decoy (listen carefully and you can even make out her horrendous crying sound), which can be applied as a distraction.
Further along in the video, Big Boss's adorable one-eyed wolf buddy (yes that's a real thing too) proves to be a particularly courageous little fella when spotting Lisa in the distance.
Also, as shown towards the end of the video, the sudden inflatability of the Lisa decoy can be particularly handy when enemies are standing on a cliff-edge.
Kojima recently announced that The Phantom Pain will release in 2015 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC. For more on the game, make sure to catch up with everything we learned from The Phantom Pain TGS 2014 trailer.

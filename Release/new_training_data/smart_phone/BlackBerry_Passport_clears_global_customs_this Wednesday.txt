To paraphrase The Beatles, BlackBerry has a ticket to 
ride this week, and they don't seem to care if US 
carriers are on board with those plans or not as the 
onetime Canadian smartphone giant thinks square for 
its latest handset.
The Wall Street Journal today reported that 
BlackBerry Ltd. plans to launch its latest smartphone 
this Wednesday, that bizarre 4.5-inch square known 
as Passport, which will sell without carrier subsidies 
for $599 (about UKœ366, AU$676).
BlackBerry Chief Executive Officer John Chen figures 
that's a bargain compared to hot new smartphones 
such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 or Apple's iPhone 6, 
which can be purchased in the US off-contract for as 
little as $649 (about UKœ397, AU$732).
Passport marks BlackBerry's first global launch for a 
handset since the ill-fated arrival of BlackBerry 10 last 
year, during which time rumors of a uniquely shaped 
smartphone with the company's classic physical 
keyboard in tow first began to surface.
Aiming for enterprise
Chen claims Passport, which is being marketed more 
to BlackBerry's traditional enterprise crowd than 
consumers, will offer battery life of 36 hours, plus a 
"large antenna" capable of better reception than rival 
handsets.
Despite the unconventional form factor, Passport isn't 
exactly a slouch in the specs department: Details of 
the 1440 x 1440 display with a pixel density of 453 ppi 
were first made public last month, and Chen says the 
higher resolution "allows users to view 60 characters 
on each line," far more than the typical rectangular 
smartphone.
BlackBerry is also throwing everything but the kitchen 
sink into Passport's internals, with to a quad-core 
2.2GHz Snapdragon 800 processor with 3GB RAM 
and 32GB of onboard storage, expandable to 64GB 
more by popping in a micro-SD card.
BlackBerry plans to introduce Passport to world this 
Wednesday with a simultaneous launch in Toronto, 
London and Dubai, followed by immediate availability 
in many stores and additional markets including Asia 
within one or two weeks.

Florida's negotiations with Colorado State football coach Jim McElwain have reached an impasse, sources tell Yahoo Sports.

The sticking point in the talks to make McElwain the Gators' next head football coach is the $7.5 million buyout clause in McElwain's current contract with CSU. According to sources, Colorado State administration is "not budging" on the buyout and that has forced Florida officials to reassess the situation.

McElwain signed the contract with the $7.5 million buyout last summer.

Sources said that Florida still wants to hire McElwain, and that McElwain is keen on taking the position, but it's unclear how big of an impediment the buyout will be moving forward.

Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley and a contingent of Florida administrators met with McElwain for several hours at his house on Tuesday night to hammer out the deal and appeared to be nearing an agreement before the impasse.

McElwain led the Rams to a 10-2 record this season and the team was a candidate for a major bowl bid from the "group of five" conferences until being upset by rival Air Force on a field goal on the final play Friday.

McElwain has Southeastern Conference experience. He is a former Nick Saban assistant coach at Alabama, working as offensive coordinator and receivers coach from 2008-11 when the Crimson Tide won two national titles.

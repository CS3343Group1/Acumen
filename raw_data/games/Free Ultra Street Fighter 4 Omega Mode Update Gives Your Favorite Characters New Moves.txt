Capcom is adding a free new mode to Ultra Street Fighter IV that changes how each fighter in the game plays, the company has announced.
The Omega mode, as it's called, will outfit each fighter with new normal and special attacks. As Capcom explains on its blog, Omega mode focuses on making the characters feel fun and new, not balance. "This means that strong, fan favorite attacks such as Ken’s Shinppu Jinrai Kyaku and Sagat’s Tiger Raid make their return while other characters such as Zangief gain new abilities, like being able to combo into his command throws," Capcom said. It added that since the mode is just for fun, it will be playable online, but not in ranked matches. In addition, the official Capcom tournaments and Capcom Pro Tour affiliate tournaments will use the default Ultra balance only.
You can see the Omega version of the fighters in the video above.
Capcom also announced that it's releasing the version 1.04 patch in October. It addresses issues pointed out by the community, and improves the online experience on PC.

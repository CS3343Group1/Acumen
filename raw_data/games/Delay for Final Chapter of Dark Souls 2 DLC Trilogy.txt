Publisher Bandai Namco has pushed back the release date for its Crown of the Ivory King downloadable content for Dark Souls II.
The DLC was previously penciled in for release on September 24, but has been delayed by more than a week to September 30 on Steam and Xbox Live, with the PlayStation Network version arriving a day later on October 1.
Crown of the Ivory King is the final part of the Lost Crowns trilogy. The add-on adventures have been released on a monthly basis since July.
GameSpot's Crown of the Sunken King review was particularly positive, writing that its "standout exploratory design and abundance of engaging enemy encounters make it a terrific adventure, though a hair short of being essential."
Its successor, Crown of the Old Iron King, also generated a positive response.

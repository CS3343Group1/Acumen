Nearly a year after unveiling the Xbox One in the US, Microsoft has finally launched its flagship gaming console for the Indian market. The device will be sold exclusively via e-retailer Amazon.in and will come in two variants – the Xbox One (sans Kinect) priced at Rs 39,990 and the Xbox One + Kinect Controller priced at Rs 45,990.

Microsoft's chief rival, Sony, has been selling its latest generation gaming console, the PS4, in the country for over nine months now. Needless to say, the US company is late in the game, but has priced the console similarly to what Sony demands for its PS4.

In an attempt to boost sales early on, Amazon.in began accepting pre-orders of the Xbox One on August 6, offering a plethora of freebies and discounts worth Rs 10,000 to the first 1,000 customers. However, the company hasn't announced how many people pre-ordered the Xbox One from Amazon to avail of these offers.

Keeping up its tactic of marketing the Xbox One as a wholesome entertainment system, Microsoft announced tie-ups with Indian entertainment houses to serve up exclusive content. “We are pleased to announce three new apps on our platform; Bigflix, Gaana and Hungama - with a wide genre of Indian movie and music content,” said Chakrapani Gollapali, Country General Manager at Microsoft.

The package includes the console, a wireless controller, a headset, a HDMI cable, 500GB hard drive and an AC power supply. Users also get a 14 days Xbox One Gold Trial Card, while users of the Xbox One with Kinect also get the Kinect controller bundled in.

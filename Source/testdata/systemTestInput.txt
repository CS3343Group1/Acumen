Moving forward, it now becomes a question of integrating these quantum wells with actual electronic devices. “When implemented in transistors, these research findings could potentially reduce energy consumption of electronic devices by more than 10 times compared to the present technology,” says Usha Varshney of the National Science Foundation, which funded UTA’s research. Because every facet of computing is interconnected by the laws of physics, a 10x reduction in power consumption could affect just about everything — from battery life, to device size and weight, to max performance.
